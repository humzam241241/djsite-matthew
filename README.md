## Logo Usage

The site includes three logo variants:

- `logo_black.svg` - For light backgrounds
- `logo_white.svg` - For dark backgrounds
- `logo_transparent.svg` - For any background

These are available in the `/branding` directory and as PNG files in `/public/branding`.

## Content Management

All content is stored in JSON files in the `/content` directory:

- `pages.json` - Page metadata and navigation settings
- `gallery.json` - Gallery images and videos
- `social.json` - Social media links

These files are edited through the admin interface or can be edited directly in development.
